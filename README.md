This is a web application which uses Html,Css,Php,Sql

To open the project first install a web server : Wampserver from https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/

After installing copy and paste the Time folder in the www folder of wamp server. for eg C:\wamp64\www

Now before starting the the project make sure to import the sgt_website database to your wampserver. 
  1.To do so you need to start your wamp server.
  2.Enter localhost in your browser. This will open up the wampserver home page.
  3.From there click on phpMyadmin and then create a data base with name sgt_website.
  4.After creating database click on import tab and navigate to the database file in Time folder.
  
Now to open the project simple type localhost/Time

login with the cridentials username: test, password : test

Note: there is already some data entered in the database for your testing purposes if you want you can enter your own by deleting the existing from phpmyadmin.
      do not delete the table but only the entries in them
      
Now to begin first you need to insert all the classe names of the institution for eg Btech Cse 1st year ,Btech Cse 2nd Year, Btech Mechanical ....etc.

Then after enter the subjects name along with its desired load. Here load means the no. of times the subject lectures to be assigned in a week, like Maths 4 times a week.

Then register the faculty members along with their subjects and classes they taught.

After that add the labs along with their rooms. As one room is used to take more than one lab.

Now click on generate time table and wait till the loading finish

Then you can view the time table both for the teacher and classes.
